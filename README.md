# todolist
This HTML code sets up the structure for a simple to-do list web application. Here's an overview and a working model of this project:

Overview:
HTML Structure:
The HTML file provides the basic structure of the webpage.
It includes a container div with a class of "container".
Inside the container, there's a div with a class of "todo" containing the to-do list interface.
The interface includes a heading "TO-DO LIST", an input field for adding tasks, and a button to add tasks.
A <ul> element with an ID of "listcontainer" is provided to display the list of tasks.
CSS Styling:
The styles for this project are defined in an external CSS file named "style.css" (not provided in your snippet).
However, it's assumed that the styles in "style.css" are used to style the elements such as the container, input field, button, and list items to make them visually appealing.
JavaScript Functionality:
The JavaScript functionality is provided in an external file named "script.js" (not provided in your snippet).
This script file will handle the logic for adding tasks to the to-do list when the button is clicked.
Working Model:
Adding Tasks:
Users can type their tasks into the input field.
Upon clicking the "Add" button, the addTask() function (presumably defined in "script.js") will be triggered.
JavaScript Logic:
The addTask() function will:
Retrieve the value entered by the user in the input field.
Create a new list item (<li>) element.
Append the task text as a child node to the list item.
Append the list item to the <ul> element with the ID "listcontainer".
Displaying Tasks:
As tasks are added, they will be displayed as list items within the <ul> element with the ID "listcontainer".
How to Use:
Open the HTML file:
Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the to-do list interface.
Add Tasks:
Type a task into the input field.
Click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.
View Tasks:
As tasks are added, they will appear as list items below the input field.
This to-do list project provides a simple interface for users to add tasks and manage their to-do list directly within the web browser.
