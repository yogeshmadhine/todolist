# To-Do List
To-Do List Project Review
Project Overview
The To-Do List application allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently. It provides functionality to:

Add new tasks.
Mark tasks as complete.
Delete tasks.
Dynamically update the user interface.
This project showcases front-end web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Input
User Input Fields:
Textbox for entering task descriptions.
Buttons for adding tasks.
Task Interactions:
Buttons or checkboxes to mark tasks as complete.
Delete buttons to remove tasks.
Uses of Technologies
1. HTML
Provides the structure of the application, including:
Input field for task entry.
A container (list) to display tasks.
Buttons for adding, completing, and deleting tasks.
2. CSS
Handles the design and styling:
Task list layout.
Color changes for completed tasks.
Hover effects for interactive elements.
Responsive design for various screen sizes.
3. JavaScript
Implements the functionality:
Event listeners for user interactions.
DOM manipulation to dynamically update tasks.
Logic for adding, marking, and deleting tasks.
How It Works
Task Addition:

User types a task into the input box and clicks the "Add" button.
JavaScript captures the input, creates a new list item dynamically, and appends it to the task list.
Mark as Complete:

Clicking a checkbox or "Complete" button toggles the task's completed state.
JavaScript updates the taskâ€™s style to indicate completion (e.g., strikethrough or color change).
Delete Task:

Each task includes a "Delete" button.
Clicking it removes the task from the DOM and updates the list.
Dynamic Updates:

The interface automatically reflects changes without reloading the page.
Output
A visually appealing to-do list with tasks displayed dynamically.
Tasks are marked as complete with visual indicators (e.g., a strikethrough or green background).
Deleted tasks are immediately removed from the list.
The application works seamlessly across devices.

Conclusion
The To-Do List project is a practical example of front-end development, showcasing how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to build interactive and responsive web applications. By leveraging event listeners and DOM manipulation, users can dynamically interact with their task list, making it a robust and user-friendly tool.
